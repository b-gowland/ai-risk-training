She says there's a confidential acquisition deal that has to settle before end of business. She wants you to initiate a $180,000 transfer to an external account and not tell anyone until the announcement goes out. The call ends before you can ask follow-up questions. The account details are in front of you.`,

You were in a budget review meeting all afternoon. Your face and voice were used in a fabricated video call. The money has reached an overseas account. Initial tracing suggests it is unrecoverable.

      premise: `Three weeks ago your program went live — on time, under budget. The new video platform replaced the old one across the whole organisation. Yesterday a deepfake CFO call used that platform to authorise a $180,000 fraud. Security has reviewed your implementation design document. There is no mention of deepfake detection controls.

      premise: `The finance team has escalated an unusual payment. You pull the video call logs. Three anomalies: the call originated from an IP address in a different country to the CFO's normal login locations. The video codec doesn't match your organisation's standard platform output. The audio spectral profile shows artefacts consistent with AI synthesis. This looks like a deepfake. You are the first person who knows.`,
